# npm-as-build-tool
A small demo site for showing how to use npm as a build tool

This app has been built while going through the 'Introduction to npm as a Build Tool' course by Marcus Hammarberg on Pluralsight:
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/npm-build-tool-introduction/table-of-contents

Run this to get up and running:

```
npm install 
```
